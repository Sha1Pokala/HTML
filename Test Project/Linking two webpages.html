    <p>
        <p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It forms the foundation of all websites by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, and more. HTML uses a system of <em>tags</em> to mark up text and other content, where each tag has a specific purpose. For example, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> defines a paragraph, <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> defines a hyperlink, and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> is used to display images.</p>

        <p>HTML is not a programming language—it doesn't contain logic like loops or conditions—but it's crucial for organizing and presenting web content. It works in conjunction with <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> to control the appearance and layout, and <strong>JavaScript</strong> to add interactivity.</p>
    
        <p>HTML documents are structured hierarchically, starting with a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration, followed by <code>&lt;html&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> sections. The <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> includes metadata, links to stylesheets, and scripts, while the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> contains visible page content.</p>
    
        <p>Modern HTML (currently HTML5) supports multimedia elements like video and audio, form controls for user input, and semantic tags (like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code>) that improve accessibility and search engine optimization. It's essential for anyone interested in web development or digital design.</p>

        <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</strong> is a stylesheet language used to control the appearance and layout of HTML elements on a web page. While HTML provides the structure and content, CSS defines how that content looks—its colors, fonts, spacing, positioning, and responsiveness.</p>

        <p>CSS allows developers to separate design from structure, making websites easier to maintain and update. For example, you can change the background color of multiple elements, adjust margins, or apply consistent font styles across an entire site with just a few lines of CSS.</p>
    
        <p>There are three main ways to apply CSS: inline (inside an HTML tag), internal (within a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>), and external (in a separate <code>.css</code> file linked to the HTML). External stylesheets are the most common and allow global styling across multiple pages.</p>
    
        <p>CSS also includes advanced features like flexbox and grid for layout design, media queries for responsiveness, and animations for interactive effects. Mastering CSS is essential for anyone aiming to create visually appealing and user-friendly web applications.</p>
